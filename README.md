#Pre-Alpha 1.01 - Added looping test scenario, trainer AI implemented, and conditions which trigger defeat and exiting the program. Also began level-up logic and level-up lookup trees/formulas.

#Pre-Alpha 1.0 - Initial gh commit with project specs 1 - 8 implemented, minimal error cases in interaction, and buildouts of scalable objects and data structures

#This program is currently implemented as a command line interface for interaction and runs a fixed scenario that loops until one trainer is defeated. Later features will include the ability to "spawn" opponents with different lineups of pokemon.

#source for implemented pokemon conventions is bulbapedia, primarily referencing Gamefreak's Gen II equations and types.
